## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We extend our sincere gratitude to anyone who reports vulnerabilities to Testsigma Community. These reports are comprehensively investigated by community volunteers as well as Testsigma Team.

To report a security issue, please email us at [security@testsigma.com](mailto:security@testsigma.com) with a detailed overview and necessary information attached. At this juncture, we don't have a bug bounty program. We are a small team trying to solve a big problem. We urge you to report any vulnerabilities responsibly so that we can continue building a secure application for the entire community.
